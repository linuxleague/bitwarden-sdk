## How to enable shell autocompletions

### Zsh

If completion is not enabled already, you need to enable it first:

```zsh
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

Enable autocompletions for the current user:

```zsh
echo 'source <(/path/to/bws completions zsh)' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Bash

Enable autocompletions for the current user:

```zsh
echo 'source <(/path/to/bws completions bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
```
